# Compression Benchmark
A simple and crude program to benchmark different standard compression methods.
It measures the compression time, decompression time and the compressed filesize

## Running
```
python benchmark.py
```

## Note
This was only tested on my personal Macbook Pro running MacOS Sonoma (14.2.1)
